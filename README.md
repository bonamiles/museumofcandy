# museumofcandy
This is a project I made as an assignment for my Web Development Course
This was created using HTML, CSS and CSS Framework Boostrap 4. 
I mostly ust implemented a design shown me for this project, I have no idea why its called Museum of candy or why the motive behind the idea of the website. But i do love the design so i implemented it and will hopefully use it for an idea that makes more sense to me in the nearest future.
